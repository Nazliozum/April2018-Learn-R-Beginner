* The [Crimes in Vancouver dataset]() we use to learn dplyr and ggplot2 package

**Topics covered**

1. RStudio orientation & good practices for data analysis

## What is R and RStudio?

What is R and why learn it? 

* one of the leading languages in statistics and data science
* open-source and free
* powerfull for data wrangling and visualization
* large library of tools (packages and functions) for diverse applications (e.g. [Bioconductor for genomic research](https://www.bioconductor.org/), [rOpenGov for social sciences](http://ropengov.github.io/about/))
* increasing number of organizations use R, find out more in this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)
* with a programming language such as R you can document the process of your data analysis, making it easier for you or another user to reproduce. This is challenging using tools such as an excell spreadsheet, where calculations are hidden in individual cells.
* R has a highly active, supportive and fast-growing user and developer community. 


What is RStudio?

* powerful and productive user interface for R
* free and open-source.

## Data analysis workflow


As adapted from R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, the maker of the many popular R packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 packages we will be working with today.

![](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Vancouver/April2018-Learn-R-Beginner/blob/master/Img/2018-April_event-presentation.jpg)

For the purpose of todays workshop we will be working with a "clean" dataset on crimes in Vancouver. This is an open source dataset that can be obtained from:

## RStudio orientation & best practices for data analysis

This is what you should see when you launch RStudio:

* the interactive console (left), a version of R you are working with will be printed there every time you start a new session
* Environment/History (top right)
* Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer

## Setting yourself up for reproducible R work

[Maybe this is not suitable for a beginner workshop?]

Before we begin producing R code, we need to familiarize ourselves with where R work is going to be located on our computer.To find out type in the console `getwd()` command. This will promt R to print out a path to a location on your computer where any scripts, plots, data you generate will be saved.

```{r }
getwd()

```


It is a good practice to keep all of your data analysis for a particular project in a single location. RStudio comes with a build in tool called R projects. To create a new project in RStudio:

1. Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.
2. Click “New Directory”.
3. Click “Empty Project”.
4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project
5. Click the “Create Project” button.


A recommendation on how to organize your R project from [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) as summarized by [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/)

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the doc directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in the data directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
4. Put source for the project’s scripts and programs in the src directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the bin directory.
5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.


> Challenge

1. Create an Rproject called “R-beginner-workshop". Click **File**>**New Project**>**New directory**>**Empty project** 
2. Create a folder called Data
3. Put the Crime.csv into folder Data

## Basics of R coding


You can clear your console with a command `ctr + L`

We can use R to do simple arithmetic: 

* division `/`
* multiple `*`
* addition `+`
* exponent `^`
* subtraction `-`

For instance, type the following in your console:

```{r }

5+5

10/5

```

The answer to this is printed below the command, preceded by [1]. Right now, none of our work exists anywhere besides the console. 

To create a script:
 1. Click File
 2. Click New File 
 3. Click R script
 4. Give your script a name

> Challenge

Create a script called “R-beginner-scripts” in your current project and put it in `scr` folder
 
 
We can annotate a script with comments using the `#`. If you precede anything with this sign, R will ignore it.  For instance

```{r }

# to do a addition in R, we do the following
5+5

```

To store results or data we need to create an object also known as a variable, using assignment operator `<-`

```{r }

# now I tell R to store my height

height_cm <- 172

```

Now, position your cursor at the line of the above command and press `CNTR + ENTER`. In the environment (top right) you should see a variable heigh_cm and it's value appear

When, we are working with a dataset, we won't be able to see the values in the environment. We can check what is stored in the variable "height_cm" by simply typing it in the new line of our scrip and running `CNTR + ENTER`.

```{r }

# what is stored in height_cm?

height_cm

```

Note, R is case sensitive. If we were to type `Height_cm` we would get an error. Try it!

```{r }

# what is stored in height_cm?

# Height_cm

```

Say you wanted to convert your heigh to inches.

```{r }

# what is my height in inches?

height_cm * 0.39

# oh wait, I want to store this value!

height_inches <- height_cm * 0.39

# what is it again?

height_inches

```

If we wanted to clear the environment of the variables we have 2 options:

* rm(list = ls())
* start a new R session - essentially a refresh button. In RStudio click "Session" > "Restart R"

> Challenge

1. Create a variable called `mass_kg` with a value of 50
2. Convert `mass_kg` to mass in pounds (multiply by 2.2) and store the answer in `mass_lbs`


## What are functions and packages?

Functions:

* fundamental building blocks of R
* a list of base R functions [explore here]()

```{r }

log(height_cm)

exp(height_cm)


```


An example of working with more than one number [work on this]

```{r }

heights_cm <- c(172, 143, 152, 180)

mean(heights_cm)

sd(heights_cm)

length(heights_cm)

```

Packages:

-> Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and (often) sample data. (From: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz)

-> Packages need to be **installed** once only, therefore we don't put these commands into the script. To install a package we use a command `install.packages("package-name")`. Today, we will be working with two packages called the `dplyr` for data wrangling and `ggplot2`for data visualization

-> Packages need to be **loaded** everytime we start a new R session. Typically this command goes on top of a script. To do so we use `library("package-name")` command


> Challenge

Install the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages.

Type the following into console. 

```{r}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("dplyr")
```
