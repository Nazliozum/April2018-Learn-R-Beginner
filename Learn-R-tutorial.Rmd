## Overview

---

This is a hands-on 3 hour tutorial for participants with no prior knowledge of programming skills. It is intended to provide an introduction into the basics of working with R...the tutorial comprises of 6 topics, after each topic there is challenge.

**Required**

* a laptop
* R and R studio installed. [Click here]() for instructions.
* we will also need be installing the "dplyr" and "ggplot2" packages during the tutorial

**Other resources**

* [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZhVXBN7cJfRrQuR2BAmUNfxt9-wMDb1_y6bt5NoWjag/edit#slide=id.g36b4849f4f_0_11)

* The [Crimes in Vancouver dataset]() we use to learn dplyr and ggplot2 package

**Topics covered**

1.RStudio orientation & good practices for data analysis   
2.Basics of coding in R  
3.Working with functions and packages  
4.Loading and inspecting a CRIME in Vancouver dataset  
5.Basics of DATA WRANGLING with the DPLYR package  
6.Basics of DATA PLOTTING with the GGPLOT2 package  


## What is R and RStudio?

---

What is R and why learn it? 

* one of the leading languages in statistics and data science
* open-source and free
* powerfull for data wrangling and visualization
* large library of tools (packages and functions) for diverse applications (e.g. [Bioconductor for genomic research](https://www.bioconductor.org/), [rOpenGov for social sciences](http://ropengov.github.io/about/))
* increasing number of organizations use R, find out more in this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)
* with a programming language such as R you can document the process of your data analysis, making it easier for you or another user to reproduce. This is challenging using tools such as an excell spreadsheet, where calculations are hidden in individual cells.
* R has a highly active, supportive and fast-growing user and developer community. 


What is RStudio?

* powerful and productive user interface for R
* free and open-source. 


## Data analysis workflow

---

As adapted from R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, the maker of the many popular R packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 packages we will be working with today.

For the purpose of todays workshop we will be working with a "clean" dataset on crimes in Vancouver. This is an open source dataset that can be obtained from:


## RStudio orientation & best practices for data analysis

---

When you launch RStudio you will be 


## Basics of R coding

---

## Loading and inspecting the Crime.csv dataset

---

## Data wrangling with the DPLYR package

---


## Data plotting with the GGPLOT2 package
