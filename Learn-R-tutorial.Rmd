## Overview

---

[remember to acknowledge sources, e.g. ResBaz, Software Carpentry]

This is a hands-on 3 hour tutorial for participants with no prior knowledge of programming skills. It is intended to provide an introduction into the basics of working with R...the tutorial comprises of 6 topics, after each topic there is challenge.

**Required**

* a laptop
* R and R studio installed. [Click here]() for instructions.
* we will also need be installing the "dplyr" and "ggplot2" packages during the tutorial

**Other resources**

* [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZhVXBN7cJfRrQuR2BAmUNfxt9-wMDb1_y6bt5NoWjag/edit#slide=id.g36b4849f4f_0_11)

* The [Crimes in Vancouver dataset]() we use to learn dplyr and ggplot2 package

**Topics covered**

1. RStudio orientation & good practices for data analysis   
2. Basics of coding in R  
3. Working with functions and packages  
4. Loading and inspecting a CRIME in Vancouver dataset  
5. Basics of data wrangling with the `dplyr` package  
6. Basics of data plotting with the `ggplot2` package

## What is R and RStudio?

What is R and why learn it? 

* one of the leading languages in statistics and data science
* open-source and free
* powerfull for data wrangling and visualization
* large library of tools (packages and functions) for diverse applications (e.g. [Bioconductor for genomic research](https://www.bioconductor.org/), [rOpenGov for social sciences](http://ropengov.github.io/about/))
* increasing number of organizations use R, find out more in this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)
* with a programming language such as R you can document the process of your data analysis, making it easier for you or another user to reproduce. This is challenging using tools such as an excell spreadsheet, where calculations are hidden in individual cells.
* R has a highly active, supportive and fast-growing user and developer community. 


What is RStudio?

* powerful and productive user interface for R
* free and open-source.

## Data analysis workflow


As adapted from R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, the maker of the many popular R packages such as dplyr and ggplot2 packages we will be working with today.

For the purpose of todays workshop we will be working with a "clean" dataset on crimes in Vancouver. This is an open source dataset that can be obtained from:

## RStudio orientation & best practices for data analysis

This is what you should see when you launch RStudio:

* the interactive console (left) with a version of R everytime you start a new session
* Environment/History (top right)
* Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer

## Setting yourself up for reproducible R work

[Maybe this is not suitable for a beginner workshop?]

Before we begin producing R code, we need to familiarize ourselves with where R work is going to be located on our computer.To find out type in the console `getwd()` command. This will promt R to print out a path to a location on your computer where any scripts, plots, data you generate will be saved.

```{r }
getwd()

```


It is a good practice to keep all of your data analysis for a particular project in a single location. RStudio comes with a build in tool called R projects. To create a new project in RStudio:

1. Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.
2. Click “New Directory”.
3. Click “Empty Project”.
4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project
5. Click the “Create Project” button.


A recommendation on how to organize your R project from [Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) as summarized by [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/)

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the doc directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in the data directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a results directory.
4. Put source for the project’s scripts and programs in the src directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the bin directory.
5. Name all files to reflect their content or function.


> Challenge

1. Create an Rproject called “R-beginner-workshop". Click **File**>**New Project**>**New directory**>**Empty project** 
2. Create a folder called Data
3. Put the Crime.csv into folder Data

## Basics of R coding


You can clear your console with a command `ctr + L`

We can use R to do simple arithmetic with these operators: 

* division `/`
* multiple `*`
* addition `+`

For instance, type the following in your console:

```{r }

5+5

```

The answer to this is printed below the command, preceded by [1]. Right now, none of our work exists anywhere besides the console.




> Challenge

[4. Create a script called “R-beginner-scripts”.Click on **File**>**New File**>**R script**]
[5. Edit the Readme file, e.g. "Scripts and data from R beginner workshop" [maybe unnecessary?]]
